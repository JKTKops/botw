# Master Sword and Dungeons

The goal is to complete the four Divine Beasts and get the Master Sword, defeating Ganon in the end.

There are two routes included in this document you may use to quickly complete this objective. At the moment, no route is considered faster than the other, it's up to personal preference of each runner.
- **[The Original Route](https://github.com/speedfuns/botw/blob/master/MasterSwordAndDungeons.md)** is the original route featured in this document. It's based on the old route of AMQ and does not use flying machine. DLC is optional for this route.
- **[The Flying Machine Route](https://github.com/speedfuns/botw/blob/master/MasterSwordAndDungeons_FlyingMachine.md)** reaches Korok Forest early, getting extra Speed Potions on the way. It also uses a different route for Zora's Domain, using flying machine. The DLC Ruby is **neccesary** for this route.

**Neither route uses Amiibo or Master Mode.**

## Route

There are 4 shrines which are roughly tied for slowest. **Only two of them are required. It is up to personal preference of the runner as to which two are completed.** These shrines will be marked by a "\*". Those shrines are:

> Shae Loya, **Aim For the Moment:** On the way and easy to route in, but requires 3 arrows and is a slow shrine. Requires getting first cycle to be competitive.

> Bareeda Naag, **Canon:** Always have a good wind launching across Tabantha Canyon, conveniently sets time of day so that it will be night in desert, shrine is very fast and easy. However, requires obtaining fire arrows, wood, and watching a cutscene, as well as changing a minor route point.

> Sho Dantu, **Two Bombs:** Not far out of the way, and makes more efficient use of Revali's Gale. However, the skip is relatively difficult and watching a cutscene is required. Heals you before Yiga Hideout on the off chance one of the Clan manages to snipe you on your way in.

> Daka Tuss, **Sunken Scoop:** Somewhat out of the way, but looks super cool to pull off. Requires getting both skips on the first attempt to be competitive. 

It is suspected that the fastest combination is Bareeda Naag and Sho Dantu, however all combinations are within roughly 10 seconds of each other.
