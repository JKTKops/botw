# Divine Beasts - Individual Levels

This write up will serve as a general guide for all Four Divine Beasts, including what you need for the each beast, a detailed route and general advice.

(WIP)

## General Setup

- **Level 3 Hasty Meal:** The speed food will make movement inside the beast much faster. An optimal Level 3 Hasty Meal is made with 4-Fleet Lotus Seeds and 1 Dragon Fang/Horn (a horn gives you a 30 minute food which is way over of what you need inside a beast). The Fleet-Lotus Seeds can be found in the Wetlands area. Dragon Fangs can be found in Hyrule Castle and Dragon Horns can only be obtained by hitting the Dragons with arrows (and also talking with Impa to spawn them).
- **Phantom/Barbaric Set:** Either set can be obtained because it gives Level 3 Attack. This will make boss fights much faster. The Phantom Set is recommended to get because it's much faster and easier to obtain, but if you don't have the DLC Pack 1 you must obtain the Barbaric Set. No upgrades are necessary for the sets since they are only used for the augmented Attack and not Defense.
- **Savage Lynel Bow:** This is the most powerful bow available during normal gameplay being a triple-shot bow with 32 Attack power. This bow is only obtainable from White-Maned Lynels. It could potentially be replaced with a Great Eagle Bow (3x with 28 Atk.) but it hasn't been tested yet.
- **Ancient Arrows:** Getting this kind of arrows is necessary to defeat the blights very fast (2 shots per cycle). It's possible to get over 20 Ancient Arrows in the Hyrule Castle area, which are enough to complete each IL.
- **Enduring Meal:** You will need an Enduring Meal that gives two wheels, this is achieved by cooking 4 Endura Carrots. This food is neccesary to make Link able to sprint without running out of stamina or using Whistle Sprinting (which is slightly slower than normal sprinting).
