# All Kass Quests

All Kass Quests requires all 8 Kass Quests, which are as follows:

- The Two Rings
- The Crowned Beast
- Master of the Wind
- The Hero's Cache
- Song of Storms
- The Forest Dragons Jaws
- Sign of the Shadow
- Under a Blood Moon

You must also do the **Recital at Warbler's Nest** shrine quest, which requires **Divine Beast Vah Medoh** to be completed.

The run timer ends once the final note ends from Kass' final song in Rito Village.

The goal is to have everything completed before the spawning of the blood moon, so that you can activate that quest and then proceed to listen to Kass' final song. Because a Blood Moon takes 2 hours and 48 minutes of in-game time you will likely have time to do really whatever you want, **as long as you're not wasting time in menus and cutscenes**. 

[Information about Blood Moons is here.](https://github.com/speedfuns/botw/wiki/Blood-Moons)

## Route

### The Isolated Plateau

Go straight to the tower and talk to the Old Man at the base. Do not use damage cancelling.

> Activating the Tower and talking to the Old Man starts in-game time. The Blood Moon timer starts as soon as you gain control in the Shrine of Resurrection so we're doing the Tower ASAP to keep track of that timer.

Complete **Oman Au - Magnesis Trial**.

Complete **SHRINE NAME - Bomb Trial**.

Do NOT warp to Shrine of Resurrection, remember that using warps and menus will stop the timer from counting.

Pick up Hylian Shrooms on the way up to heal yourself in the cold.

Complete **SHRINE NAME - Cryonis Trial**.

Do not get the Doublet. Heal as needed.

Complete **SHRINE NAME - Stasis Trial**.

Go get the **Paraglider**.

### Ridgelands

Grab a horse off the edge of **Oman Au - Magnesis Trial**. 

> It is not recommended to use Amiibo as you will get an extra dialogue box the first time you use it, as well as needing to switch runes.

Ride first to Impa and talk to her, and accept the Main Quests.

> We have to talk to Impa to spawn the Dragons and it will save time by not having Zelda talk after the Vah Medoh intro.

Ride to the **Two Rings** shrine quest and complete it. Make sure to talk to Kass first.

> Talking to Kass first prevents an extra dialogue box, and a possible glitch of him not showing up in Rito village for some reason.

Ride to Tabantha Stable. 

Activate the Shrine.

Get the 500 rupees from the fairy guy.

> You can pick up the sword and axe here if you think you'll need it.

> Do not stasis to Rito Village as that will require you to heal.

Try and get some Flint on your way past the Talus.

### Divine Beast Vah Medoh

Purchase 2-4 Sun Shrooms and cook them.

Activate the Shrine.

Talk to the Elder, then to the Wife.

Paraglide to Flight Range and eat the cold resistance meal as soon as you turn cold.

Grab the arrows on the table and do the minigame.

Take the Falcon Bow and get the Bomb Arrows from Falco. Equip them after you receive both.

Enter and complete Vah Medoh.

### Rito Village

Paraglide to Warbler's Nest and activate the Shrine Quest.

Get the food from the 3 kids and cook them for the 4th kid.

Grab the Korok Leaf if you need it and complete the Shrine Quest.

> If you can grab a Korok Leaf elsewhere you can save time from not talking to the kid first.

### Lanayru

Ride back through Kakariko and past the Fairy Fountian.

> Grab some Fairies here for safety, unless you're super brave.

Take a left at the fork and complete **The Crowned Beast**.

Ride to the beach and complete **Master of the Wind**.

Ride back past Kakariko and head to Hateno.

### Hateno

Ride past Hateno Tower and down to the beach.

Use 1 Gale to get to Kass and finish the quest. 

Use 1 Gale to get back to shore.

Ride back up and past the Hinox Brothers to Faron.

### Faron

Do the **Song of Storms** Shrine Quest.

Farosh should be flying around. Get a scale from him. DO NOT DIE.

Walk or run to the **Forest Dragons Jaws** Shrine Quest. Talk to Kass and use gales to complete it.

### Gerudo 

Warp to Cryonis and fly through Gerudo to the Tower.

Accept the **Sign of the Shadow** Shrine Quest from Kass. Use gales to get up there.

Either wait for the sun or the moon to line up with the tower and shoot an arrow at it.

### Under a Blood Moon

Warp to Tabantha Stable, grab wood and some flint from deposits nearby if you still need them.

You have time to grab a fire weapon if you need it. 

Gale and talk to Kass.

At this point you will have to wait until 11AM on the 7th day. After then, sit at a campfire twice and stand on the dias to finish the quest.

### Final Song

Warp back to Rito and listen to the final song.
