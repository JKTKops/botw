# All Dog Treasures RTA

The goal is exactly what it sounds like, get all treasures revealed to you by dogs. This will require the completion of Tarrey Town. Timing ends when the last chest is opened.

For Tarrey Town, you will need 3000 rupees and 30 wood to buy your house, then 110 wood to help build the town. This is 3000 rupees and 140 wood in total.

Another thing to note is that it requires 4 pieces of food to befriend a dog, so be sure to grab lots of fruit and meat throughout the run.
